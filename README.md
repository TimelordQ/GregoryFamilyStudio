# Gregory Family Studio

A PC User Interface which leverages VLC with FLIRC for an easy to use home entertainment system

When used with the FLIRC device, a user can access a home library of movies (in MP4 format) on a regular tv hooked to a computer with a videos directory all with  an old remote controller using the FLIRC USB device (available here https://flirc.tv/).
